# Cue
Cue is a tool that assists children with visual processing issues and language learners when reading and practicing a new language. 

You can read a passage to the web app, and it will help you visualize what you're reading by providing real-time images as visual cues. Words from the input will be colour coded based on their type (noun, adjective, verb, etc.).
